This application gets restaurant competitors and calculates distance to them.

This is simple, just type http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
Then choose one address from left bar and push the button on the right. 

You will see all the neighbors (Mcdonalds and KFC restaurants) at a distance of no more than 2 km 
around the selected address.
